# Web Portfolio

For this site, I intend to include explanation of my important CS projects. I want an about me section and then below it I want to include the important projects I did in this class and other classes. I also want to include links to my linkedin and github.


Usability Testing:
Is the website easy to follow and use? What is the overall effect of the site?
